 * Create a vertex shader to control vertex position controlling.
 * This should grab data from the webgl canvas context that is passed to the webgl program.
 * Fragment shader will be responsible for the color of each vertex as well as interpolation
 * 
 * next create your webgl context, then create a webgl program,add the shaders to the program, link them, do all the boiler plate stuff tog et it going
 * You also need to pass buffers that hold information about the vertex position and color to the webgl program to use
